# cape-k-mcc-clouds
Exploring the impacts of aerosol, precipitation and meteorological factors on open and closed MCC clouds
## Science Questions
- Do the open and closed MCC clouds have different aerosol (e.g. CCN/CN) characteristics?
- Do the open and closed MCC clouds have different precipitation characteristics?
- Are there environmental or meteorological factors (e.g. wind, atmospheric stability) modulate the relationships you observe above?
